## What is MudkiPC?

MudkiPC is a brand new application that is built from the ground up to be a simple yet feature rich Pokémon editor and compendium.

# Key Features:

## A Modern Save Editor 📝

Step aside Hex Editors, MudkiPC is now the easiest way to edit your trainers and Pokémon. Want to move an old trainer to a newer game? Now you can, its that simple! Plus, you can even transfer Pokémon to another game and even Pokémon Showdown!

## Cross-Platform\* 🖥️📱💻

MudkiPC is built using Dart & Flutter, which in layman's terms mean that it can run any modern device, including Linux and mobile!

(MacOS and iOS versions are currently impossible for me to compile, as I do not have a Mac system. Looking into getting one though!)

## Blazingly Fast 🚀

With SQLite at its core, MudkiPC is bar none the fastest way to search and find your Pokémon... or anything for that matter.

## Completely Self-Contained 🗄️

Hate how most apps today require dependencies and a constant internet connection to work? Well, do not worry. MudkiPC is completely self reliant, no extra-downloads needed.

## Extremely Detailed 🔎

Ever wanted to know the true size of Wailord? No? Well, now you can. Thanks to the hard working [PokéAPI](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi?tab=readme-ov-file) team, MudkiPC can give you nifty graphs, height charts, spreadsheets, and every other nerdy way to show data. Neat right?

# Why MudkiPC?

Because Mudkip is my favorite Pokémon. MudkiPC is just combination of Mudkip and PC. Mudkip + PC = MudkiPC. Simple!

## How do you pronounce it?

You can pronounce it in two ways:

- _Mud_-_Ki_-_P_-_C_

  or

- _Mud_-_Kip_-_C_

It does not matter, choose one or the other.

# Consider Sponsoring ❤️

I would love to continue working on this for the foreseeable future, however, for me to do that I need support. Consider sponsoring me on GitHub so I can continue working on this project! If you can't, no worries, you can spread the word about this project instead. Thanks!
